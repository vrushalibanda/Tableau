# Tableau
1.	Create a Tableau Worksheet (Worksheet 1) with Text Table Visualization based on Contoso DW that shows the Sales Quantity and Inventory on Last Day of Period for every month of 2009 (Columns) and across every category hierarchy (Rows)
2.	Calculate Stock to Sales Ratio and create a new worksheet  with line graph visualization (Worksheet 2) that shows the variation in stock to sales ratio over different months of 2009 across different products categories
3.	November/December (Thanksgiving-Christmas Holiday Season) is the peak selling season of the products in Audio/Bluetooth Headphones subcategory. The stock to sales ratio is expected to increase at the beginning of this season (November) as the retail stores stock up on the product and then trend downward towards the end (December) as inventory is depleted. Using Worksheet 1 and Worksheet 2 analyze the stock to sales ratio trends of different products within the Audio/Bluetooth headphone subcategory to see if the sales and inventory trends are as expected. Identify any deviations and use the Drill Down Roll Up operations to identify causes of deviations (low sales or high inventory, 3 examples is sufficient).
